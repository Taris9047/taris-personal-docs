  \item PL3 -- n+ a-Si:H/nc-Si:H
  \item PL5 -- Si Sputtering
  \item PL7 -- Excimer laser annealing
  \item ITZ -- Robotic arm transport 
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Procedures}
This section was written assuming a-Si:H deposition in PL2 chamber. Make sure main gas valves are opened in gas line controller next to process room prior to deposition. MFC(Mass Flow Controller) valves are usually turned on for WLO1 unlike Reel-to-Reel machine. The gas cylinder pressure, check them in the gas line controller room, should be over 100 psi.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Vent the Load Lock and prepare substrate holder with samples.
  \item Put holder back to the Load Lock and close door.\footnote{Keep a 5 mm gap}
  \item 'Rough' until the Load Lock pressure become 20 mTorr. \\
    Don't forget to close 'Rough' valve if the pressure is low enough. Too low pressure might reverse the lubricant oil from rotary pump and contaminate the samples.
  \item Check ITZ pressure ($<$ 10\superscript{-6}) using Ion Gauge (IG).
  \item Open Gate Valve 1 (GV1).
  \item From robotic arm panel, select Chamber $\rightarrow$ Load Lack and hit 'Get' button. Robot arm will take out the wafer holder from Load Lock and stay at ITZ.
  \item Close GV1 and open GV2. Check whether GV2 is opened.
  \item Again, from the robotic arm panel, select Chamber $\rightarrow$ PL2 and hit 'Put' button to place the substrate holder into the PL2. Confirm the robot arm action is finished prior to close GV2.
  \item Close GV2 and setup the process parameters. 
  \item Wait until substrate temperature reaches desired temperature. It takes about 1 hour.
  \item Press the MFC, Gas Valve, and Main Valve buttons connected to PL2.
  \item Hit 'Pr' (Pressure) button to setup chamber pressure and wait until desired pressure achieved.
  \item Hit 'Tm' (Timer) button to ignite plasma. To confirm the plasma visually, look through the PL2 chamber via look glass. If the plasma is not ignited, turn off the timer and increase RF power a bit and try to re-ignite the plasma. 
  \item Always check the plasma, gas flow, pressure during deposition process.
  \item Once the plasma confirmed, wait until timer value dissipates to zero. The RF will automatically run off once the timer finishes. 
  \item Hit 'Op' for Throttle valve. Turn off very gas valves, MFCs connected to PL2. Wait until PL2 base pressure drop under 10\superscript{-6} Torr level.
  \item Open GV2, hit 'Get' at the robotic arm control panel after selecting PL2 chamber to take out the substrate holder from PL2. 
  \item Close GV2 and open GV1. 'Put' the substrate holder in the robotic arm control panel.
  \item Once the robotic arm is secured in ITZ, close GV1 and wait for 1 -- 1.5 hours to cool down the substrate holder.
  \item Vent the Load Lock and retrieve your samples. Don't forget to return Load Lock pressure at 2 $\times$ 10\superscript{-2} Torr, or 20 mTorr using 'Rough'.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Robot Arm Manipulation}
Due to the malfunction problem of the robot arm, we decided to operate the robot arm manually when moving the wafer tray into the load lack(LL). The procedure below assumes the wafer tray is located in the ITZ, mounted on the robot arm.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Open the gate valve of LL to see the robot arm operation.
		\item Operate the robot arm normally: LL, then Put.
		\item Stop the robot arm when it starts move towards LL by pressing `F1' on the keypad.
		\item Hit `LP1' (Learn Position 1) on the keypad then press `ENTER'.
		\item While holding `CTRL', press `$($B' 6 times.
		\item Hold `$>$E' until the substrate tray is 1 cm away from the stopper.
		\item Hold `-F' to lower the substrate tray to settle down in the LL.
		\item Hold `$<$D' until the robot arm is out of the LL chamber.
		\item Hit `RS1' then `ENTER' to reset the robot arm.
		\item Wait until a second beep then close the LL gate valve.
	\end{enumerate}

\captionof{figure}{Schematic of Plasmatherm. Adopted from CzangHo Lee's thesis.}
\label{fig:Plasmatherm}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Standby Temperature: 130 \superscript{o}C
\item Standby Pressure (Chamber): less than 1 $\times$ 10\superscript{-5} Torr.
\item The chamber must be cleaned prior to actual usage. (Use hi\_lo\_pr.prc)
\item In the back room (Gas control room), check whether rotary pumps working.
\item Prepare some glass plates and dummy wafers to prevent flying sample wafer accident.
\item Cleaning process is a mandatory one since the system has only a single process chamber.
\item Schematic can be found at Fig. \ref{fig:Plasmatherm}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, close main valve gate to prevent any possible damage to pumps. \\
Utilities $\rightarrow$ Close Gate
\item After confirming the gate is fully closed, Vent the chamber. \\
Utilities $\rightarrow$ Vent
\item Open the chamber after hearing 'tsk' sound from pumping mechanism. It indicates the chamber can be opened. (The panel shows 'cyan' colored process chamber when it is ready to open)
\item Place your wafers carefully. Try to place them in the middle of chamber.
\item Close chamber and start pumping with 'Low Vac' pump. Pump it until the chamber panel shows 'white' color. 
\item From this point, use 'Turbo' pump to achieve Hivac condition. It will take at least from the point that we turn on the 'Turbo' pump.
\item Wait until the chamber pressure reaches below 10\superscript{-5} Torr. Confirm this using ION gauge. Turn off ION gauge as soon as confirming pressure to preserve its lifetime.
\item Revise your process recipe ('.prc' file) and Load it. \\
Process $\rightarrow$ Edit/Process $\rightarrow$ Load
\item Press 'Ready' button at the bottom side of process control program. It will automatically setup the substrate temperature as your desired temperature.
\item Once the substrate temperature reaches recipe value, 'Run' the process. The process usually ends with Helium flush and cooling down procedure so that we can open the chamber right after process ends.
\item Follow previous procedures to open the chamber and unload samples.
\item Follow previous procedures to vacuum the chamber and run the cleaning process and leave. \\
Cleaning process can be found at 'C:$\backslash$sysmon$\backslash$cleaning'. Use 'hi\_lo\_pr.prc'.
