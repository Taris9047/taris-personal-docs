Mammo, mean exposure: 12mR (= P, this is the value that will be used)
Mammo, exposure range: 0.6-240mR

conversion of exposure to number of photons per mm2:
at 20keV, Theta = 5.05552e+07 ph/.mm2/R
This was calculated using the energy absorption coefficient of air and the
following reference:
H. E. Johns and J. R. Cunningham, The Physics of Radiology, Fourth edition,
Thomas, Springfield, IL, 1983

No = Theta*P*A = number of photons incident on the device, where P is the
exposure (R), A is the 
surface area the photons are incident upon. If the number of photons per unit
area are required, then use:
No = Theta*P = number of photons per area.


*******get the energy deposition profile*******

Note that the following equations assume No is the number of incident photons
(ph). Concentration of photons (ph/m) that interact at depth 'x':
N(x)=No*mu*exp(-x*mu)
where mu is the attenuation coefficient (1/m).

Energy deposited (concentration) at depth 'x' (assumes each interacted photon 
deposits all its energy locally):
Edep(x) = Eph*No*mu*exp(-x*mu)
where Eph is the energy of the photons, and Edep (keV/m) is energy deposited.

*******use klein's rule for conversion energy*******

Electron-hole pair creation energy
W ~= 2.8*Eg + 0.5 eV
From:
S. O. Kasap and J. A. Rowlands, Photoconductor selection for digital flat 
panel x-ray image detectors based on the dark current, 2000, Papers from the 
ninth canadian semiconductor technology conference, v. 18, n. 2, pp. 615-620

#Silicon band gap Eg = 1.12eV
#So W = 3.636eV
Silicon band gap Eg = 1.15eV
So, W = 3.72 eV

Concentration of electron-hole pairs (ehp/m) as a function of depth 'x':
EHP(x) = Edep(x) / W
Remember that Edep and W should have the same energy units, i.e. both in eV or 
keV.


*******generate concentration*******

Using all of the above, the concentration of electron hole pairs is:
EHP(x) = (1/W(keV))*Eph(keV)*mu(1/m)*exp(-x(m)*mu(1/m))*Theta(ph/mm^2/R)*P(R)*A(mm^2)

However, in Medici you will want the EHP(x,y,z), which is the 3D 
concentration of electron hole pairs. This will change the equation to the 
following:
EHP(x,y,z) = (1m/100cm)*(1m/100cm)*(1m/100cm)*(1000mm/1m)*(1000mm/1m)*(1/W(keV))*Eph(keV)*mu(1/m)*exp(-x(m)*mu(1/m))*Theta(ph/mm^2/R)*P(R)
where I have converted it to number of electron-hole pairs per centimeter cubed
and there is no variation of this quantity along 'y' or 'z'. You're initial 
concentration of electrons and holes will be identical using this method. Also 
note that x=0 is the top of the device, where the photons hit first. 

I have attached the EHP(x,y,z)/cm^3 file, ehp.txt, where the first column
is depth 'x' and the second column is EHP(x,y,z)/cm^3.
